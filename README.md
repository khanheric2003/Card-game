#  This is a simple card game. We represent a deck of 52 cards comprising 13 ranks in each of the four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades.
#  Each suit includes an Ace, a two, a three, a four, a five, a six, a seven, an eight, a nine, a ten, a Jack, a Queen, and a King.  # two computer players will compete with each other # There are five cards in each hand and the player with more Ace cards is the winner.
